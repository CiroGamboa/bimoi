# Bimoi project context

- **Product scope and requirements:** Read [docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) for the full MVP spec, user stories, edge cases, and domain model. Treat it as the source of truth for what is in/out of scope.
- **Domain types:** Use or extend [src/bimoi/domain/](src/bimoi/domain/) (Person, RelationshipContext). A contact in the system is a Person with exactly one RelationshipContext; both are created atomically.
- **Agent overview:** See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for repo layout, setup commands, and conventions.

When adding features or handling Telegram flows, align with PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and reuse bimoi.domain types.
