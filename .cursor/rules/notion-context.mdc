# Notion project context

Project tasks and user stories are tracked in **Notion**. When the user asks for:
- project status, or
- the user story / task for the current branch (or a named branch),

use **Notion MCP** to fetch and summarize: search or query the tasks database (e.g. by Branch field or task ID). Return the relevant story, acceptance criteria, and status. Branch names follow the convention `feature/US-<id>-<slug>` (e.g. `feature/US-1-add-contact`); the user may also ask to update status in Notion (e.g. mark as In progress or Done) if the integration has edit access.
